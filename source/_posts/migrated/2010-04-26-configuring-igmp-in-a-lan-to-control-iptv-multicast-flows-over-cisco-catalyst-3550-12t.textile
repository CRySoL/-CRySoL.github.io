<blockquote>
In this article a scheme with one device <i>Cisco Catalyst 3550-12T</i> [1] that combines the functions of both a switch and an IGMP querier is described. Catalyst 3550-12T switch has 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and two ports for GBIC modules. Peak performance is 17 billion
packets per second that allows transmitting data at a 24 Gbps rate.
</blockquote>

<h2>Configuring IGMP snooping and IGMP querier</h2>

<p>
It is required to have an IP address configured on the Vlan 1 interface of the switch:
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
!
interface Vlan1
 ip address 10.1.2.247 255.255.0.0
!
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
IGMP snooping is enabled by using the command (in global configuration mode):
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
ip igmp snooping
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
IGMP querier is enabled by using the command (in global configuration mode):
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
ip igmp snooping querier
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
A stand on basis of Cisco Catalyst 3550-12T ( C3550-IPSERVICESK9-M, Version 12.2(40)SE ) and
NetUP DVB to IP gateway [2] was prepared by NetUP specialists. A general network scheme is
given in the figure 1 below. As the client equipment it was used a PC with vlc mediaplayer and
an IP set-top box AmiNET 130.

<p>
IGMP snooping and IGMP querier were enabled as discussed above. To check this, one can
use the following commands (the output is provided):
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
c3550#show ip igmp snooping querier
Vlan      IP Address        IGMP Version   Port
----------------------------------------------------------------
1         10.1.2.247        v2             Switch

c3550#show ip igmp snooping groups
Vlan      Group             Version     Port List
------------------------------------------------------------
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
As it can be seen the switch operates as an IGMP querier. In the groups list there are
no groups as no subscriber has requested a multicast stream. In this case the average
data transfer rate on the client's port equals 0 Mbps. To check this run the following
command:
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
c3550#show interfaces GigabitEthernet 0/2 | include 5 minute
  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
 {% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
At that on the port of NetUP DVB to IP gateway we can see data transfered
at the rate of 110-120 Mbps (full decoding of 4 transponders is performed
that is around 50 TV channels):
</p>



<div>
{% highlight text %}
c3550#show interfaces GigabitEthernet 0/1 | include 5 minute
  5 minute input rate 125753000 bits/sec, 11558 packets/sec
  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
Due to IGMP snooping multicast packets are not coming to the client port. If the client
requests a TV channel, copied to his port are only those multicast packets that belong
to this TV channel. To check this let's request a TV program on the client's device:
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
vlc udp://@226.2.0.5:1234
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
The requested TV channel appears on the client's TV screen. And on the switch in the groups list we can see a new record:
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
c3550#show ip igmp snooping groups
Vlan      Group             Version     Port List
------------------------------------------------------------
1         226.2.0.5         v2          Gi0/2
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
As we can see from this record, the switch is copying multicast packets for the group 226.2.0.5 to
the client port (Gi0/2). To check this we can check the rate of data transfer to the client port:
</p>


<div>
{% highlight text %}
c3550#show interfaces GigabitEthernet 0/2 | include 5 minute
  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
  5 minute output rate 3300000 bits/sec, 304 packets/sec
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
As it can be seen, only one TV channel is being transfered to the client port at the rate of ~3 Mbps. Because of such behavior of the switch we avoid overloading the client's port with unwanted multicast packets.
</p>

<p>
It is worth of noting that the CPU load of the switch is almost zero. Most likely
multicast packets are processed at the hardware level.

<p>
<b>Important!</b> According to "IPv4 Multicast Unusable Group And Source Addresses" [3] it is not recommended
to use certain ranges for IPv4 multicast addresses. For example, subnet 226.0.0.0 - 226.0.0.255. Cisco
Catalyst 3550-12T switch sends multicast packets to all ports regardless of client's requests.
