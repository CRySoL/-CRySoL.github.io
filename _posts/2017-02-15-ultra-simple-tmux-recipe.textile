This is a new try to start using tmux. I am absolutly convenced about advantages of tmux, but for some strange reason, I am not able to learn its key combos...

I hope this recipe should be a way to have the very basic functions always at a glance.

|_. Panes           |_.           |
| horizontal split  | C-b %       |
| vertical split    | C-b "       |
| move cursor       | C-b <arrow> |
| close             | C-b x       |
| maximize/minimize | C-b z       |

|_. Windows         |_.       |
| create            | C-b c   |
| change            | C-b <n> |

|_. Session         |_.                        |
| detach            | C-b d                    |
| attach            | tmux attach -t <n>       |
| list              | tmux list-sessions       |
| kill              | tmux kill-session -t <n> |
