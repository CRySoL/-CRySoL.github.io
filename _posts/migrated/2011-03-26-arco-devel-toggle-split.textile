The new version of the "arco-devel":/arco-devel package (0.66-1)  includes an emacs command (@toggle-window-split@) and keybinding (C-x 4) for toggle between vertical and horizontal two-buffer layouts. To use that, just add the next lines to your @.emacs@:


<div>
{% highlight text %}
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/arco-tools/emacs")
(load "toggle-split.cfg")
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<!--break-->
