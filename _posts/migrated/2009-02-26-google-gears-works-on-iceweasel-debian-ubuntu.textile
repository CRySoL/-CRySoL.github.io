How to install Google Gears on Iceweasel.
<!--break-->
Everybody knows Iceweasel is actually Firefox 3, everyboby except Google. When you visit <a href="http://gears.google.com">http://gears.google.com</a>, an ugly message says "your browser is not supported". 

The solution is easy: trivial user agent cheating :-)

# Point your iceweasel to "about:config".
# Find a key called "general.useragent.extra.firefox" and edit to "Firefox/3.0.5"
# Then, visit <a href="http://gears.google.com">http://gears.google.com</a> again and install.

Remember activate the add-on and set the permissions to the gears web applications.
