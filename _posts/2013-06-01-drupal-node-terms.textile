Migrating a drupal-6 site to jekyll I need to get *term names* to add the @tags@ entry in the post YAML from-matter.

I am using the jekyll-import ruby gem. The modification is easy and can be added directly to the "drupal6":https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/blob/master/lib/jekyll/jekyll-import/drupal6.rb plugin.

I apologize if this code smells. I am not a ruby programmer... yet.
