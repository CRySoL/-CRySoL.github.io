@sudo@ lets a user run commands as she was a different user (usually root). The common configuration of @sudo@ requests your password before run the command. As that is annoying, you may be tempted to write something like this in your @/etc/sudoers@:

<pre>
john   ALL = ALL, NOPASSWD: APT
</pre>

But this may be a big security issue.

h2. Fine grain

Something more convenient is to specifically set which commands can be executed without password. Next sudo configuration makes this possible:

<pre>
Defaults        env_reset, insults
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
Defaults        timestamp_timeout=15

Cmnd_Alias APT = /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/dpkg
%sudo   ALL = ALL, NOPASSWD: APT
</pre>

The commands in the "alias" @APT@ can be executed by users in the group @sudo@ without a password. For all other commands, @sudo@ take the usual behavior.

Also, with that configuration:

* It insults you if you type a wrong password.
* It caches the password during 15 minutes.
