Non shell unix users are useful to run services or daemons, but sometimes you may need a shell to test something failing...

<!--break-->

When a user do login on a system a program is executed. This program is usualy a shell, but it may be any other. That program is specified in last column in the file @/etc/passwd@:

<pre>
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bacula:x:104:106:Bacula:/var/lib/bacula:/bin/false
</pre>

Here, the user @bacula@ has @/bin/false@ as shell. So when @bacula@ do login, the system execute @false@ and imediatly is log out.

@root@ can use open a shell for the specified user just with:

<pre class="console">
root@example:~# su bacula -s /bin/bash
bacula@example:/root$
</pre>
